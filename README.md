# Python-Week-1

Introduction to Python:

> How are files store on a computer memory, in blocks
> To access the file location we can use a pointer to the location of the file
> Files can be stored as 'Text files - Strings or characters, Integers, Floats, Hexadecimal'
> A file name has to have a specific data type before is stored on the memory of a computer
> File names are reffered to as variables, and they can either be declared empty or initialised a value
> Computer machines uses what is reffered to as a pseudocode to read and execute programs (Algorthm)
> This a summury of how a Computer thinks

> How to install python and run it on your machine:
> For one to be abale to run a python program on their machines they must have a python Extension/Software installed
> Installing Jupyter Notebook, which is a web based IDE to run python codes, and we can also run a python code on the terminal
> We can also use a text editor like Vs Code. to run python code, to edit or modify our codes

Variables and types:

> Vars in python just like in any other programming language can be integer, floating point, strings of char, boolean
> These are the data types a variable cann take before it is stored on the computer memory
> Every variable must be correctly asigned to its correct data type to avoid errors
